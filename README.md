### What is a black hole?
A black hole is a region in space with gravity so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape it, formed from the collapsed core of a massive star or other processes, containing immense mass in a tiny volume, defined by a boundary called the "event horizon" where escape becomes impossible.

In 1916, Albert Einstein publishes his theory of gravity also known as the **general theory of relativity** where the **Einstein field equations** (**EFE**) relate the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter within it:

$$R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu \nu}$$
